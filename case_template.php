                                   As is common with our one-off development projects, this started as a ground-up development engagement, and evolved into a long-term dedicated team relationship. Our client is working to become a leader in the domain registration and domain monetization space. To accomplish this goal, he first required a cutting edge, highly secure registrar management system, then moving on to require continuous support to stay on the cutting edge of technology and usability trends.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The project was executed as a weakly defined agile project. Each sprint started with a conceptual meeting to translate the end user experience the customer wanted to achieve into wire frames, and subsequently constructing the backend functionality to support the wire frames. Due to the loosely defined nature of the customer’s requirements, the first few phases of development consisted entirely of reusable prototyping and incremental elaboration of the init al data model and object models. Multiple client-location meetings took place in order to clarify the scope of the project.

                                    The client now enjoys his position as an industry-leading domain registrar and domain monetization service. The synergy that the client has developed with their dedicated development team has resulted in a direct client-to-team development relationship with minimal interaction (and billing) with our US-based project and technical management team. With growing vertical experience and cultural integration between the client’s product management process and the development team, total cost of ownership and time to market ad vantages are realized on each subsequent system and feature rollout.

                                    The project was executed as a highly defined agile project. The first sprints of the project produced complete working wireframes of the user-experience.

                                    Project successfully delivered with low total cost of ownership. The client enjoyed a dramatic improvement in their initial vision of the project through the intellectual collaboration of Pilgrim management with the client ’s product manager. Pilgrim’s relationship with the client continues to expand based upon the trust built on this initial project. The platform is now live on the Ne t and enjoying success on the market.
